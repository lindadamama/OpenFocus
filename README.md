## <span role="img" aria-label="overview">🔭</span> Overview
OpenFocus is a PyQt6-based multi-focus registration and fusion workstation that delivers commercial-grade alignment and blending results. The project is fully open source (MIT License) and runs on CPU by default with optional GPU acceleration for the StackMFF V4 neural model.

## <span role="img" aria-label="highlights">✨</span> Highlights
- **MIT Licensed & Free Forever**: Ready for commercial, research, and personal use without licensing friction.
- **Flexible Processing Flows**: Run fusion-only, registration-only, or combined registration + fusion pipelines depending on your workload.
- **Batch Automation**: Kick off batch jobs across multiple folders with live progress, cancellation, and automatic output organization.
- **Annotation & Export Toolkit**: Overlay labels, export GIF animations, and save processed stacks in JPG/PNG/BMP/TIFF with consistent metadata handling.
- **AI-Assisted Fusion**: Ship with StackMFF V4 to unlock deep-learning-quality fusion alongside classic signal-processing methods.

## <span role="img" aria-label="fusion methods">🧪</span> Fusion & Registration Methods
Mix and match the built-in algorithms to suit your data:
- **Guided Filter**: Fast edge-preserving fusion that enhances contrast while suppressing noise.
- **DCT Multi-Focus Fusion**: Frequency-domain technique optimized for crisp detail recovery.
- **Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT)**: Multi-scale representation that preserves fine texture structures.
- **StackMFF V4 Neural Model**: Pretrained deep model delivering state-of-the-art focus stacking quality.
- **Hybrid Registration**: Homography, ECC, or combined strategies ensure robust alignment across challenging captures.
